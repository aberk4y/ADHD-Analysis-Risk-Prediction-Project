# ADHD Analysis & Risk Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing ADHD-related data using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify patterns within the dataset, perform preprocessing, and build classification models to estimate ADHD risk levels.

In addition to standard classification, the project includes a risk prediction module designed to estimate the probability of ADHD-related risk based on input features.
