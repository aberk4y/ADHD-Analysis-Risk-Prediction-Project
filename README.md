# ADHD Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing ADHD-related data using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify patterns within the dataset, apply preprocessing techniques, and build classification models to evaluate predictive performance.

The project demonstrates practical experience in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation using Python-based tools.
